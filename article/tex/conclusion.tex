\section{Conclusion}\label{section:conclusion}

This paper presented a comparison between several methods related to NEAT:
\emph{standard NEAT, cascade-NEAT, NEAT with novelty search and ``unified'' NEAT} where
in one game only one individual whose neural network is used for every unit is evaluated
instead of evaluating all the population.
To do so, an open source C++ library for NEAT and a Starcraft Bot using it was developed.
The default AI was used to measure performance of the Bot by playing against it.
Four matchups were considered: marines vs marines, marines vs zerglings, vultures vs vultures
and vultures vs zealots.

While no statistical difference has been foundâ€¦
