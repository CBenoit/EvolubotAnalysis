\section{Discussion}\label{section:discussion}

All the experiments where done in stochastic conditions, meaning that there is a
probability of hitting the target or missing it and the amount of damages
can vary.
We ran experiments at full speed, that is without any sleeping frame.
However, \citet{Liu14EffectiveMicro} discovered that game speed affects outcomes as well
and it's thus preferable to not use the fastest settings possible.
By the time we saw that, there was no time remaining to start again from scratch.
Moreover we didn't averaged individual fitness over multiple runs so it's possible that
good individuals were killed early and didn't passed their genes.
One solution to mitigate this problem is to run several games with the
same population and compute indivial fitness from the average of each game.

One problem with neural networks is always the inputs and outputs.
Are the inputs useful? Is there enough of them? Should we increase granularity
in the output choices? For instance, instead of just using an hardcoded procedure
to decide which unit to attack, we could let the network decide alone and select
the enemy itself. On one hand, a few adequate inputs/outputs speed up considerably
the evolution procedure while on the other hand, bigger granularity let room for more
emergent behaviours but slow down the evolution. It's also possible to find no viable
solution either because there is not enough inputs, no useful inputs or because
a very long time is required because of big granularity. It's all a tradeoff.
For instance, a grid based vision has been used by \citet{Shantia11ConnectionistSC} but the method
used is quite different and do not use NEAT. We believe that all the NEAT variants
explained in this paper aren't adequates for a neural network with high dimensionality
and maybe the HyperNEAT variant which is specifically designed to exploit geometric
properties of big neural networks is better suited for this kind of
problem~\cite{Stanley09HyperNEAT, Gauci10TopographicRegularities}. It has been
successfully applied to play the Go game~\cite{Gauci10Go}.

Cascade-NEAT wasn't really better than standard NEAT.
This is probably because the problems used were in fact not that fractured.
Moreover, it doesn't performs more bad either which can mean that
no reccurent neural network is required to solve the problem like in the
non-Markovian double pole-balancing problem where a reccurence is absolutely
required~\cite{Kohl09FracturedProblems}.

In subsection \ref{subsec:spreading} we talked about a spreading behaviour which
allowed vultures to quickly gain large vision on the map and then converge on the enemy
position from several sides. We think this is an interesting behaviour that is good
to replicate. That being said, the pure neural approach is probably not the best for that and
Potential Fields seems be very good for this kind of problems~\cite{Hagelback08RTSPotentialFields, Svendsen12SCPotentialFieldsGP}
and should be explored even more. It may be interesting to study a possible mixed usage of both.
Sometimes a good mixed usage surpass both methods individually like for neural-fitted
Q-learning~\cite{Riedmiller05NeuralFittedQ} or neural-fitted Sarsa~\cite{Shantia11ConnectionistSC}
(neural network and temporal difference learning together).
