Techniques:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Vanilla NEAT
    \item Cascade-NEAT
    \item Novelty Search and vanilla NEAT
    \item `Unified' networks with vanilla NEAT
\end{itemize}

A fresh C++ implementation of these methods was developed and is hosted on Github under the name of NEToolKit\footnote{\url{https://github.com/CBenoit/NEToolKit}}.

The Starcraft bot can be found on Github as well under the name of Evolubot\footnote{\url{https://github.com/CBenoit/Evolubot}}.

The analysis of the data was performed with the R language. Source can, again, be found on Github\footnote{\url{https://github.com/CBenoit/EvolubotAnalysis}}.
